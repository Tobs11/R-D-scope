# R-D-scope
A simple python script that, once ran, records all clicks and things typed down in text, and takes screenshots. All of these are put into folders.

Folders will be like this:
  console.py
  people
    *NameOfUsers*
      *Date*
        Screenshot
        Screenshot
        Screenshot
        user_input_log.txt
      *Date*
    *NameOfOtherUser*
And so on and So forth.

If you set up the email correctly, you can email the user_input_log.txt to yourself.
